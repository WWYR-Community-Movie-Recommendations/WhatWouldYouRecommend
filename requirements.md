# Software Requirements for WWYR? (What Would You Recommend?) Project

## Vision

The vision of WWYR? is to provide users with personalized and trustworthy movie recommendations from their own community. The application aims to solve the pain point of users feeling overwhelmed by impersonal algorithm-based movie suggestions. By offering a community-driven platform, users can discover movies recommended by people they know and trust, making the movie selection process more enjoyable and meaningful.  

## Scope (In/Out)  

**IN - What will your product do:**

  1. Provide a recommendation submission form where users can easily input their favorite movie recommendations, along with comments, their contributor details (identifying themselves), and a YouTube trailer link.

  2. Generate a randomly selected movie recommendation for users based on the user-submitted list, complete with a YouTube trailer, contributor details, and comments.

  3. Create a dedicated data page showcasing a well-organized list of all movie recommendations submitted by users, displaying titles, YouTube trailers, contributor names, and comments.

  4. Consider potential enhancements for the application, such as adding a rating system for movies, allowing users to add personal notes to watched movies, and creating recommendation playlists.  

**OUT - What will your product not do:**

The application will not provide movie recommendations from external sources or employ impersonal algorithms to generate suggestions. It will not support the ability to watch full movies within the app, as it is focused on providing movie information and trailers.  

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP) vs Stretch Goals:**

**MVP Functionality:**  

1. Recommendation submission form for users to input movie recommendations, comments, contributor details, and YouTube trailer links.
2. Random movie recommendation generator from the user-submitted list, including YouTube trailer, contributor details, and comments.
3. Dedicated data page presenting an organized list of user-submitted movie recommendations, showing titles, YouTube trailers, contributor names, and comments.  

**Stretch Goals:**  

1. Implement a rating system, allowing users to rate the movies they have watched.
2. Enable users to create and manage recommendation playlists, grouping movie suggestions based on themes or genres.
3. Filter through complete list of movie recommendations by contributor, genre, or keywords.

## Functional Requirements

1. Users can access the recommendation submission form and input movie details, comments, contributor information, and YouTube trailer links.
2. The application should generate a random movie recommendation for users upon request, displaying the movie title, YouTube trailer, contributor details, and comments.
3. Users can explore the complete list of movie recommendations through the dedicated data page.

**Data Flow:**

1. User starts the application and accesses the recommendation submission form.
2. User inputs their favorite movie recommendation, comments, contributor details, and YouTube trailer link.
3. Submitted data is processed and saved in the database (local storage for now).
4. When another user requests a random movie recommendation, the application retrieves a movie recommendation from the saved data (local storage).
5. The selected movie details, including the YouTube trailer, contributor information, and comments, are presented to the user.
6. Users can explore all movie recommendations through the dedicated data page, which displays the organized list of titles, YouTube trailers, contributor names, and comments.
